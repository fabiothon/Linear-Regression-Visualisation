# Linear Regression Visualisation
## Description
This Python code creates a linear regression plot based on a study conducted by Powell et al. (2013). The plot visualises the correlation between smoking intensity and lung cancer risk in men and women, as well as overall odds ratios (OR). 
The dataset includes odds ratio values (OR) along with their confidence intervals for various smoking intensities: Never Smoked, Light/Trivial (1-9 cigarettes/day), Moderate (10-19 cigarettes/day), and Heavy/Very Heavy (>20 cigarettes/day).
The visualisation is divided into three categories: Overall Odds Ratio, Men Odds Ratio, and Women Odds Ratio. Error bars in the plot represent the confidence intervals for each odds ratio.

**Please note**: This code is for educational purposes only. Partly synthetic data is used.
